# Sentiment Analysis on Restaurant Reviews 🍽️🧠

This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews from online food platforms like Zomato to determine whether the sentiment is **positive** or **negative** using machine learning techniques.

This project was developed as part of my **IBM AI & Machine Learning Internship**, where I worked on real-world sentiment analysis use cases.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP.
2. Open `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Run all the cells step-by-step.
4. The model will preprocess the text, train using a classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression), and display the accuracy and prediction results.
